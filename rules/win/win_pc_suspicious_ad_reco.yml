id: 164eda96-11b2-430b-85ff-6a265c15bf32
status: experimental
description: |
    Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
    The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
    Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.
